            <h3>Recipe Website References</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> This is the  <a href="https://www.molliekatzen.com/recipes/recipe.php?id=1047">website</a> of the recipe's original author. While this recipe is very clear to follow, the visuals of the website are not really engaging, and I found the color palette unappetizing. She may not make beaitufl webpages, but her recipes are damn good!</li>
                <li> I wanted to include the <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018825-gazpacho?action=click&module=Local%20Search%20Recipe%20Card&pgType=search&rank=1">NYT cooking platform</a>  as I am intimately intune with the usability and interface of the platoform, cooking from it multiple times a week. I really appreciate how the platform has situated the ingredients alongside the instructions. This allows the user to view the ingredients and the instructions simutaneously. The worst thing while cooking is trying to scroll through a recipe with dirty fingers! Lastly, I appreciate how they have sperated the ingredient list into the different elements of the recipe they correspond to.</li> 
                <li> The last platform which I use on occasion is <a href="​​https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/passion-fruit-bars">Bon Appetit.</a>  Their interface is quite similiar to the NYTcooking platform. I think they establish a nice hierarchy within the wesite and the recipes are easy to follow.</li>

            <h3>Other Website References</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I really appreciate the use of bold typography throughout this <a href="https://www.eateryberlin.com/de/rezepte/osterbrot-sandwich​​">website from Eatery Berlin</a>. I found that typically on other recipe platforms the type was pretty minimalistic and modern. However, Eatery Berlin utilized a typeface with a bold sharp serif which brought some character to the site. </li>
                <li>I really loved the playfulness of this <a href="​​https://www.bottleonthetable.com/en/concept.php">website for the brand bottle on the table.</a>. I found the interface both intuitive to use while also playful in a way that felt parallel to their brand. Once again I was drawn to the strong bold typography and angular movement throughout the website.</li>
                <li>I love the use of illustration and texture on this <a href="https://crazyabouteggs.com/​​">website called Crazy About Eggs.</a>. This website feels grounded, sophisticated, and approachable at the same time. I really loved the loading animation on this platform.</li>
