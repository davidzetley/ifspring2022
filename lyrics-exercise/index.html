        I'm comin' home to you, wear something see through <br>
        So I can see your heart<br>
        For night can never come soon enough for me<br>
        I watch the sky all day<br>
        <br>
        Night is where I find you and peace of mind<br>
        My days are filled with grief<br>
        That's why I truly give you what you need<br>
        Because you love me for me<br>
        <br>
        Good runs all through you, I can't help myself<br>
        You found my weakest spot<br>
        What better woman to breathe and sleep next to<br>
        That's why I'll always be with you<br>
        <br>
        Yes, I'm funny like a clown, but I'm never down<br>
        As long as you're around<br>
        There will never be a normal way for me<br>
        'Cause you are shinin' beneath me<br>
        <br>
        You'll never have to beg me to come to bed<br>
        I'll walk you there each night<br>
        If you want me to that's what I will do<br>
        That's why I'll always be with you<br>
        <br>
