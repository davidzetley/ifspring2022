            <h1>David Zetley's Intro Questions!</h1>
          
            <p>1.David Zetley, Marketing and Communication Design, Senior
            </p> 
            <p>2.As a Second major in Communication Design I am required to take this class to graduate. I am excited to learn more about HTML and CSS and be able to build out webpages.
            </p> 
            <p>3.I have some basic Java experience having taken CS131 at WashU my Sophomore year. Additionally I have taken a few workshops as a part of other Sam Fox Courses on the basics of HTML, CSS, and a bit on p5.js.
            </p> 
            <p>4.I am really hoping to learn how to make basic buttons and simple interactions on webpages! I also am excited to know how to use/upload custom fonts to use on a webpage.
            </p> 
            <p>5.One way that designing for screen is different than designing for paper is that the web browser changes size therefore requiring your design to adaptive to the screen size!

            </p> 
            <p>6.I think that this <a href="https://wetransfer.com/ideas-report/2021">Ideas Report by WeTransfer</a> exemplifies effective design. Not only is the webpage intuitive to use, but utilize strong typography and visuals to create a coherent hierarchy.

            </p>
            <p>7.I think that the <a href="https://eyeondesign.aiga.org/">AIGA Eye on Design homepage</a>  exemplifies effective communication. It has a clear hierarchy and is easy to find the most recent articles. The headlines and subheaders and legible yet differentiated.

            </p> 
            <p>8.I really like the way <a href="https://www.eater.com/maps/best-restaurants-st-louis-missouri">EATER </a>organizes their restaurant lists. Not only are you able to read a bit about the highlighted restaurants, but you are also able to locate them on a map to plan a trip/determine your proximity to them!
